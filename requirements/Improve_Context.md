# Improving Chatbot Context and Response Quality

## 1. Summary of the Problem

The chatbot exhibits two primary issues that impact user experience:

*   **Incomplete Responses:** When first asked about a product, the chatbot sometimes provides partial information (e.g., only the price, without key features), even when the full information is available. This is largely due to a vague system prompt that encourages overly "concise answers."

*   **Context Loss on Follow-up:** The chatbot fails to retain context in a conversation. If a user discusses a product and then asks a follow-up question using a pronoun (e.g., "What about *its* features?"), the chatbot doesn't understand what "it" refers to. This happens because the product information is not saved between turns; it is fetched and used for a single turn only and then discarded.

## 2. The "Augmented History" Plan

To resolve these issues, we will implement the "Augmented History" strategy. This approach is simpler and more efficient than complex relevance checks and relies on the language model's strong contextual reasoning abilities.

The core idea is to change what we save in the conversation history.

*   **Current Method:** The system saves only the user's raw, original input to the chat history. The `Relevant product information` found for that turn is used once and then lost.

*   **New Method:** The system will save the **augmented user message** to the history. This means the user's original input *plus the `Relevant product information`* will be stored together as a single `user` turn in the context.

### How It Works: A Trace

1.  **User asks:** "Tell me about GameSphere Y."
    *   The system finds product info for "GameSphere Y".
    *   It saves the following to the chat history: `role: 'user', content: 'Tell me about GameSphere Y\n\nRelevant product information:\n{...info...}'`.
    *   The model provides a full answer based on the rich context.

2.  **User asks a follow-up:** "What about its features?"
    *   The system finds no new products in this query.
    *   When it builds the prompt for the model, the chat history now contains the full product information from the previous turn. The model can clearly see what "it" refers to and has all the data needed to answer the follow-up question comprehensively.

3.  **User changes the topic:** "What are your store hours?"
    *   The system finds no products.
    *   The new, unrelated question is simply appended to the history. The model is capable of identifying that this is a new question and will answer it directly, ignoring the older product context from previous turns.

### Advantages of This Approach

*   **Solves Context Loss:** Directly fixes the follow--up question problem by persisting product information in the chat history.
*   **Simpler and Faster:** Avoids adding extra, slow "relevance check" API calls, keeping the chatbot responsive.
*   **Handles Topic Changes Gracefully:** Allows the model to adapt to sudden changes in conversation topic without getting confused.
*   **Improves Prompt Logic:** Correctly and logically associates product data with the user query that triggered it, creating a clean and coherent context chain for the model.
